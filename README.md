Dom = document object model

front-end and back-end

user interacts with a rendered document (index.html) that carries the style.css, algo calls main.js for example, and the other many folders as well.

-----------------

what are the resctrictions of that?
im not able to store data.
recover data (same?)
also other users are not able to access the same data
that's a system that works only local

-----------------

which are the main differences between front-end and back-end?

front-end 
 - presentation
 - usability
 - visual effects
 - screen transitions
 - interactions 

 back-end
- business rules (doesnt make any sense doing this in frontend)
- database
- single point to center all the business rules

protocol : http?

npm = note pack manager
npm init -y => initialize application
npm install express

node server.js <-> deliver the data through the server
cntrl + c to interrupt the server 
clear?
cd - navigating between the folders

arrays are always split by comma remember that

api = application programming interface
this is basically an interface that the user is not an human being, the user is just another machine.
